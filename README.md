# Webpack-react-config

Allows to keep webpack react config in node module,
so its easier to update its dependencies and less boilerplate code in project

I've taken most of configuration from this boilerplate - [https://github.com/HashemKhalifa/webpack-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/HashemKhalifa/webpack-react-boilerplate)
It have MIT license at time of writing this.
Big thanks to Hashem Khalifa for creating this awesome Webpack/React configuration.
